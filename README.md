# Youtube v3 Livestream Downloader

I wanted something to download and save livestreams from a certain channel since I'm not always around when they stream and they don't save the videos to their channel.

This script runs forever watching and waiting for a livestream to start, then downloads the video and converts it to mp4 for more universal playback.

*WIP*
